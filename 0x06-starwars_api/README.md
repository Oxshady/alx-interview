## Description
This project involves writing a script to interact with the **Star Wars API** to fetch and display information about characters based on a provided movie ID. The objective is to retrieve character names from the specified movie, listed in the order they appear in the API response. This exercise demonstrates proficiency with making HTTP requests, handling API responses, and managing asynchronous code in JavaScript.

## Concepts Covered
- **HTTP Requests in JavaScript**:
  - Making requests to external services using libraries like `request` or `fetch`.
- **Working with APIs**:
  - RESTful API interaction and parsing JSON data.
- **Asynchronous Programming**:
  - Handling asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises, and async/await.
- **Command Line Arguments in Node.js**:
  - Accessing and utilizing command-line arguments via `process.argv`.
- **Array Manipulation and Iteration**:
  - Iterating over and manipulating data structures.
