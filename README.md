## Overview
The **alx-interview** repository is part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum and focuses on solving real-world algorithmic challenges, mastering coding problems, and building technical knowledge. This repository covers topics such as:
- **Data Structures and Algorithms**
- **APIs and System Design**
- **Database Management**
- **Web Development**
- **Programming Languages (Python, JavaScript, etc.)**

Each project is designed to improve problem-solving skills, reinforce important concepts, and prepare participants for technical interviews.
